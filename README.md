A Great way to play with colours 

This is an RGB Colour Game to learn about how computers represent colours and ho different colours combine to form new colours.

This is very interesting game in which you will be given a random RGB value and a certain number of boxes filled with different colurs.

You have to identify the box which has same colour as described by RGB value.
If you pick the wrong one then that box will disappear and you can again make choice.
If you pick the correct one then all other boxes will get same colour.

There are 2 levels in game:
1. Easy : In this level yoy will be given only three box you identify the correct one.
2. Hard : You will be given six boxes and you have to identify the correct one.


The reason i decide never to end game on making incorrect choice is that this game is for learning purpose. If player get more chances to find the right one he/she will learn better.
